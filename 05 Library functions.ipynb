    "\n",
    "A feature of modern programming languages is an extensive library of *standard functions*. This means that we can make use of well-tested and optimised functions for performing common tasks rather than writing our own. This makes our programs shorter and higher quality, and in most cases faster.\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce use of standard library functions\n",
    "- Importing and using modules\n",
    "- Introduction to namespaces\n",
    "- Print formatting of floats\n",

    "\n",
    "You have already used some standard library types and functions. In previous activities we have used built-in types like `string` and `float`, and the function `abs` for absolute value. We have made use of the standard library function `print` to display to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a large standard library. To organise it, most functionality is arranged into 'modules', with each module providing a range of related functions. Before you program a function, check if there is a library function that can perform the task. The Python standard library is documented at https://docs.python.org/3/library/.\n",
    "Search engines are a good way to find library functions, e.g. entering \"Is there a Python function to compute the hyperbolic tangent of a complex number\" into a search engine will take you to the function `cmath.tanh`. Try this link: https://bfy.tw/7aMc."

    "of NumPy (https://www.numpy.org/), which is a specialised library for numerical computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to install a non-standard library is using the command `pip`. From the command line, the library NumPy is installed using:\n",
