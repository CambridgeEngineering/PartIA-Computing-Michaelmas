It is good to re-use code as much as possible because we then focus testing and debugging efforts, and maybe also performance optimisations, on small blocks of code that are then re-used. The more code that is written, the less frequently sections of code are used, and as a consequence the greater the likelihood of errors.\n",

To understand at a high level what a program does, we usually just need to know what data is passed into a function and what the function returns. It is not necessary to know the precise details of how a function is implemented to grasp the structure of a program and how it works. For example, we might need to know that a function computes and returns $\\sin(x)$; we don't usually need to know *how* it computes sine.\n",
