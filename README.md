# Introduction to computing with Python for engineering and scientific applications

These Jupyter notebooks provide a self-study introduction to computing
with Python. They have been developed for the computing course in Part
IA (Michaelmas Term) of the Engineering Tripos at University of
Cambridge. This is a first computing course for undergraduate students.

The notebooks can be freely used, shared and modified. See the copyright
and license notice below.


## Viewing and running

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CambridgeEngineering/PartIA-Computing-Michaelmas)

Cambridge users should use their University credentials (CRSid) to log in.

## Getting started

Each notebook covers a topic, with a number of exercises for completion
at the end of each notebook. Start with the notebook [Part IA Michaelmas
Term computing](00%20Part%20IA%20Michaelmas%20Term%20computing.ipynb). Model
solutions to the exercises are available - contact [Garth N.
Wells](<gnw20@cam.ac.uk>) to request the solutions.

Cambridge students/staff: When prompted to sign in to the Google
Colaboratory service, use your University of Cambridge email address,
e.g. `crsid@cam.ac.uk`.


## Accompanying exercises

For each notebook there are a set of exercises in the directory
[Exercises](./Exercises/) for completion at end the of each Activity
notebook.
